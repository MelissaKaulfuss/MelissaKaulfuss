# Hey folks :wave:

My name is Mel Kaulfuss and I'm a software engineer and now developer advocate at [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com). I'm from Melbourne, Australia. You can find me on [![Twitter][1.2]][1]. There are hardly any green tiles on my profile because I mainly worked in private repos during office hours.

## &#x270d; Other things

Apart from coding and tweeting - you can find my writing on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/melissakaulfuss). 
I also occassionally make sticky tape art & obsessively watch Nordic Noir TV series'.
